The rotor should be prefixed by turbine_rotor as
turbine_rotor_HK22cm.stl

The rotating domain is called an arbitrary mesh interface (AMI),
AMI.stl

The rest of the turbine components should be included with the prefix turbine_comp as
turbine_comp_stator.stl
turbine_comp_diffuser.stl
turbine_comp_tower.stl


All .stl files should be in ASCII format and not in binary.
